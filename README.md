# Academia (Course registration portal)

This is an implementation of a course registration developed for the Operating Systems Lab project.

The following OS fundamentals were used for the implementation:

- `Socket programming`: For setting up a tcp client-server architecture.
- `Multithreading`: For server to handle multiple clients concurrently.
- `File locking`: To prevent race conditions to shared resources.
